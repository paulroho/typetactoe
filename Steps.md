# Steps in Refactoring Towards Types

The refactoring towards types started with completely un-typed but well tested code: 58 tests passing.

Still those tests cannot prove the absence of defects: You **can** find ways to break the production code without breaking the tests.

Also, the tests are probably over-specified, making refactoring of the production code hard. But that's not the point of this exercise :)

## Step 1: Type for Player and ColumnContent

    type Player = 'X' | 'O';
    type ColumnContent = Player | ' ';

Tests for Player do not compile anymore / are redundant:

    [' ', 'A', 'Y', 'Z', 'N', 'Q'].forEach(value => it('throws an exception when value to set is neither X nor O, but "'+value+'"', () => {
        const board = new Board();

        expect(() => board.set('TOP', 'LEFT', value)).to.throw('Illegal player character: "'+value+'"');
    }));

    it('does not throw an exception when player character is valid ("O")', () => {
        const board = new Board();

        board.set('TOP', 'LEFT', 'X');
        board.set('TOP', 'CENTER', 'O');
    });

Now the check for the player character can be removed from the production code:

    if(!(playerCharacter === 'X' || playerCharacter === 'O')) {
        throw 'Illegal player character: "'+playerCharacter+'"';
    }

7 Tests removed - 51 passing. Two boolean sub-expressions and one exception removed from production code.
